# Mine-vs-Rock-Prediction
Given Sonar Data, predict wether the object is a mine or a rock using Logistic Regression

### Choice of Model: Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical method that models the probability of a binary or categorical outcome based on one or more independent variables. It uses the logistic function, a sigmoidal curve, to model the relationship between the variables and the outcome. The logistic regression model estimates the coefficients of the independent variables, which represent the change in the log-odds of the outcome for each unit change in the corresponding independent variable. The model is trained on a labeled dataset using an optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent, to minimize the error between the predicted probabilities and the true labels. The output of the model is a probability value between 0 and 1, which represents the likelihood of the outcome being true or false, given the values of the independent variables. Logistic regression is a widely used and interpretable model in various fields to predict the likelihood of an outcome based on input variables.
